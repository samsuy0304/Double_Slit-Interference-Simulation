# Double-Slit Interference Simulation
This code simulates the interference pattern that arises when light passes through two slits and interferes with itself. The simulation uses a wave function to model the light, and calculates the interference pattern on a screen placed a certain distance away from the slits.

## Usage
To run the simulation, simply run the main.py script. The simulation parameters can be modified at the start of the code. The following parameters can be modified:

* wavelength: the wavelength of the light in nanometers.
* slit_width: the width of each slit in micrometers.
* slit_distance: the distance between the centers of the two slits in millimeters.
* screen_distance: the distance between the slits and the screen in centimeters.
* screen_width: the width of the screen in centimeters.
* screen_resolution: the number of pixels per unit length on the screen.

The simulation generates an image of the interference pattern on the screen, which is saved in the output folder.

## Dependencies
This code requires the following Python packages:

* numpy
* matplotlib
