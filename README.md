# Interactive Double Slit Experiment with PyQt
This code simulates the interference pattern formation on a imaging sensor. The simulation is intended as a way to explore the various factors that affect the capture of a such a pattern. 

## Usage
To run the simulation, simply run the app.py script. The simulation parameters can be modified in the side bar. The following parameters can be modified:

* Wavelength: the wavelength of the light in nanometers.
* Slit Width: the width of each slit in micrometers.
* Slit Distance: the distance between the centers of the two slits in millimeters.
* Screen Distance: the distance between the slits and the screen in centimeters.
* Screen Width: the width of the screen in centimeters.
* Screen Resolution: the number of pixels per unit length on the screen.


## Dependencies
This code requires the following Python packages:

* numpy
* matplotlib

## Contribution
If you would like to improve the model, feel free to fork the repository. I have been intending to work on developing the image capture system to be more realistic.
